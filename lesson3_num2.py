# This script leverages the properties of sets to automatically remove duplicates and then prints out 
# the unique customer IDs. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the code within it runs 
# only if the script is executed as the main program, allowing for proper functionality and output display.
# Feel free to test this script, and let me know if you need further assistance or have any additional tasks!
